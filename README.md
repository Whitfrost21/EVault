# EVault - E-Waste Scraper and Recycling System

EVault is an innovative e-waste management solution designed to accept and process recycling requests specifically for electronic vehicles. The system allows users to schedule waste collection requests, choose their location on a real-time map, and utilizes GraphHopper API to trace optimal routes, calculate time, and distance. The system uses Go for the backend with a Fyne-based GUI for easy user interaction.

## Features

- **E-Waste Collection Requests**: Submit the request with specified details.
  !["Add Requests"](https://github.com/Whitfrost21/EVault/blob/master/Screenshots/Reqform.jpg)
- **Real-Time Map Integration**: Can select location on real-time map, (i used osm with leaflet.js for this).
- **Route Calculation**: Uses GraphHopper API to trace the best routes and calculate the distance and time to the pickup location.

- **Automatic Monitoring**: The system checks pending requests every 5 minutes to ensure smooth operation.
- **In-App Notifications**: Notifications are sent to the users when a collection request is completed.

- **Scalability**: Designed to scale to handle increasing numbers of users and requests efficiently.

## Technologies Used

- **Go (Golang)**: Core backend logic for processing requests and server-side operations.
- **Fyne Framework**: GUI framework for frontend development and user interface.
- **GraphHopper API**: For route tracing, distance, and time calculation for pickups.
- **OSM with leaflet.js**:For real-time mapview integration.
